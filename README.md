#### Overview

Pocket Bracket lets users search for, view, and register for esports tournaments. The app is composed of 3 main sections:

- Tournament Search - lets the user search for tournaments using several filters
- My Tournaments - displays all tournaments the user has registered for and/or competed in
- My Profile - displays the user's smash.gg profile

#### Feature Roadmap

###### Native Tournament, Bracket, and Attendee Views - In progress

Currently, the app uses webviews to display pages for tournaments, brackets, and attendees. The information in these webviews should be displayed in native app screens instead.

###### Tournament Organizer Tools

Add tools for tournament organizers to create and run tournaments from within the app.

###### Detailed Profiles

Currently the profile screen only displays basic information about the user. Profiles should contain additional users info. Some examples of additional info to include could be:

- A player schedule, similar to https://smash.gg/user/31d46d72/schedule
- A detailed breakdown of user placings in tournaments, and a timeline to show improvement
- Statistics on character usage, placings, tournaments attended, etc.
